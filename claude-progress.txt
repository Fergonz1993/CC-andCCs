## Known Issues

1. Option C agent.py uses --print which exits after one prompt
   - Impact: Workers can't execute multiple tasks
   - Fix needed: Spawn new process per task OR use Claude SDK directly

2. No dependency cycle detection in add_task()
   - Impact: Could create deadlock with circular deps
   - Fix needed: Add topological sort validation

3. No worker crash recovery
   - Impact: Crashed workers leave tasks in limbo
   - Fix needed: Heartbeat timeout + task reset
