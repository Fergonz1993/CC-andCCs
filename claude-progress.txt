# Claude Progress Notes - CC-and-CCs Multi-Agent Coordination
# ===========================================================
#
# This file maintains development progress across Claude sessions.
# INSTRUCTIONS: Read this file at the START of each session to orient yourself.
#
# File Locations:
#   - feature_list.json: 210 features to implement/verify
#   - CODING_AGENT.md: Detailed session instructions
#   - init.sh: Environment setup script
#   - CLAUDE.md: Project context
#
# ===========================================================

## Current State

Total Features: 210
- Option A (File-Based): 0/50 passing
- Option B (MCP Broker): 0/45 passing
- Option C (Orchestrator): 0/105 passing
- Integration: 0/10 passing

Overall Progress: 0/210 (0%)

## Priority Queue

High Priority (fix these first):
1. [ ] Verify Option C imports work (int-006, int-007, int-008)
2. [ ] Verify Option B builds correctly (opt-b-build-001, opt-b-build-002)
3. [ ] Verify Option A CLI works (opt-a-init-001 through opt-a-init-010)

Medium Priority:
4. [ ] Task model tests (opt-c-model-001 through opt-c-model-030)
5. [ ] CLI tests (opt-c-cli-001 through opt-c-cli-025)

Low Priority (polish):
6. [ ] Integration tests
7. [ ] Documentation improvements

## Known Issues

1. Option C agent.py uses --print which exits after one prompt
   - Impact: Workers can't execute multiple tasks
   - Fix needed: Spawn new process per task OR use Claude SDK directly

2. No dependency cycle detection in add_task()
   - Impact: Could create deadlock with circular deps
   - Fix needed: Add topological sort validation

3. No worker crash recovery
   - Impact: Crashed workers leave tasks in limbo
   - Fix needed: Heartbeat timeout + task reset

## Session Format

When starting a session, add an entry below:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] SESSION #N - <your-summary>
- What you worked on
- Features tested: X passing, Y failing
- Commits made
- Next steps
```

## Session Log

<!-- Add new sessions at the top -->

[2026-01-19 21:30] SESSION #0 - Initial Harness Setup
- Created long-running development harness
- Files created: init.sh, feature_list.json, claude-progress.txt, CODING_AGENT.md
- Updated CLAUDE.md with harness documentation
- Features tested: 0 (harness setup only)
- Next: Run init.sh, verify setup, start testing features

## Test Results Log

Format: [DATE] FEATURE_ID | PASS/FAIL | Notes

<!-- Add test results here as you verify features -->


## Discoveries

Important findings to share across sessions:

<!-- Add discoveries here -->


## Notes

- The feature_list.json contains 210 features organized by category
- Each feature has specific test steps - follow them exactly
- Only mark a feature as "passes": true after thorough verification
- Commit frequently to avoid losing work
- If context fills up, update this file first before ending session
