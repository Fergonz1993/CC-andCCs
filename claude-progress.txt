## Known Issues (from v1.0.0)

These issues are now tracked as features in v2.0.0:

1. Option C agent.py uses --print which exits after one prompt
   → Now: adv-c-003 (Agent process recycling for long-running tasks)

2. No dependency cycle detection in add_task()
   → Now: adv-c-plan-001 (DAG-based task execution with cycle detection)

3. No worker crash recovery
   → Now: adv-a-rec-001 (Checkpoint and restore for interrupted tasks)

## Test Results Log

Format: [DATE] FEATURE_ID | PASS/FAIL | Notes

<!-- Add test results here as you verify features -->


## Discoveries

Important findings to share across sessions:

- v1.0.0 complete: Basic coordination working across all three options
- File locking uses fcntl on Unix, msvcrt on Windows
- MCP server has 15 tools and 4 resources
- Option C orchestrator supports async task execution

<!-- Add discoveries here -->


## Notes

- The feature_list.json now contains 200 ADVANCED features (v2.0.0)
- Previous 210 basic features are complete (archived in git history)
- Focus on implementing actual functionality, not just verification
- Each feature has specific implementation steps - follow them
- Only mark a feature as "passes": true after thorough testing
- Commit frequently to avoid losing work
- If context fills up, update this file first before ending session
